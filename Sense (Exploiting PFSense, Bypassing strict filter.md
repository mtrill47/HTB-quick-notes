# Sense (Exploiting PFSense, Bypassing strict filtering)

Sense, while not requiring many steps to complete, can be challenging for some as the proof of
concept exploit that is publicly available is very unreliable. An alternate method using the same
vulnerability is required to successfully gain access.

# Skills Learned

- Modifying publicly available exploit

# Problems I Ran Into

This box is ranked `easy` by Hack The Box, but the official walkthrough states it is a medium machine. Maybe this is due to the enumeration. The famous Offensive Security mantra `Try Harder` really just comes to play here, but at the same time you could try harder and it just doesn't work cause the box has connection issues and it is just very slow when running directory brute-force tools. 

The walkthrough itself states that you required wordlist is the dirbuster list `lowercase medium wordlist` found in `/usr/share/wordlist/dirbuster/`. Well I ran this wordlist and still it couldn't find the file `system-user.txt`. I'm not even sure what the problem was but it has to be some connectivity thing. To save yourself the heart ache the credentials are `rohit:pfsense`. You can login and begin more enumeration that leads to the final exploitation.

For this I found `CVE-2014-4688`. Follow me on Twitter and happy hacking!
